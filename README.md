# Welcome to Simple Countdown!
## Introduction
This is a Pomodoro-based countdown desktop app, but equipped with the ability to play music.

## Technologies used
.NET MAUI

## Motivation
This app removes the hassle of setting up the timer, and selecting the suitable audio/music during work, by implementing all of them into one.

## Project/Build Status
1.0 (Deprecated)

## Code Style
Object-Oriented, using the MVVM Model 

## Use Examples

## How to use
### For Windows
Since .NET MAUI (to date) hasn't support the build for native desktop app, the only way to run this file (so far) is to prepare:
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET MAUI Framework (which can be found in the Visual Studio Installer -> Modify/Update -> .NET MAUI Development section)

After downloading all of the dependencies, just click Run in Visual Studio, then you are done.
### For Android/iOS
I really haven't planned to write this application specifically for these platforms, so up until now, tutorials for these platforms are not available.
